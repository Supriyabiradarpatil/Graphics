# Graphics
In RStudio, graphics are an essential tool for data visualization, providing insights that are often difficult to grasp from raw data alone. R offers several powerful graphics systems, including base R graphics, ggplot2, and lattice. Base R graphics functions, like plot(), hist(), and boxplot(), are straightforward and suitable for quick, basic visualizations. For more detailed and customizable plots, ggplot2—part of the tidyverse—uses a layered approach that allows for complex, publication-quality graphics, making it highly popular among data analysts. Additionally, the lattice package is ideal for visualizing multivariate data in a structured way, offering multi-panel plots that display distributions across groups. For interactive visualizations, RStudio also supports integration with Shiny, which allows users to create web applications with dynamic, interactive charts that respond to user input. These various approaches give RStudio flexibility for both static and interactive data visualizations, making it a versatile environment for data exploration and communication.
